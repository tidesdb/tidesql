# Spatial Indexes

TidesDB supports `SPATIAL` indexes for geographic and geometric data using a Hilbert-curve encoding
on the LSM-tree. Rather than an R-tree, which needs in-place node updates that clash with
append-only LSM semantics, each geometry's MBR center is mapped to a 64-bit Hilbert value and stored
as a sorted key in a dedicated column family.

```sql
CREATE TABLE places (
  id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(100),
  location GEOMETRY NOT NULL, SPATIAL INDEX (location)
) ENGINE=TIDESDB;

INSERT INTO places VALUES (1, 'NYC', ST_GeomFromText('POINT(40.7128 -74.0060)'));
```

## Queries

MBR-based predicates work through the standard MariaDB spatial functions:

```sql
SELECT name FROM places
WHERE MBRIntersects(location, ST_GeomFromText('POLYGON((39 -76, 43 -76, 43 -72, 39 -72, 39 -76))'));

SELECT name FROM places
WHERE MBRWithin(location, ST_GeomFromText('POLYGON((25 -125, 45 -125, 45 -70, 25 -70, 25 -125))'));
```

The supported predicates are `MBRIntersects`, `MBRContains`, `MBRWithin`, `MBREquals`, and
`MBRDisjoint`, and all geometry types are supported, POINT, LINESTRING, POLYGON, MULTIPOINT,
MULTILINESTRING, MULTIPOLYGON, and GEOMETRYCOLLECTION.

## How it works

Each geometry is a single index entry. The key is the 64-bit Hilbert value of the MBR center,
big-endian for lexicographic ordering, followed by the primary-key suffix, and the value stores the
full MBR (four doubles) for predicate evaluation during a scan. The Hilbert curve gives good spatial
locality, geographically close geometries tend to have numerically adjacent values, so they cluster
in the LSM-tree and read sequentially.

A spatial query uses Hilbert range decomposition instead of scanning the whole index. The query
bounding box is mapped to a coarse grid on the curve, only the cells overlapping the box are kept,
those cells are merged into contiguous Hilbert ranges, and the engine seeks directly to each range.
Each candidate then passes exact MBR filtering to drop false positives from the curve approximation.
For a box covering about 1% of the coordinate space this is typically tens of targeted seeks rather
than a full scan. The one predicate this cannot accelerate is `MBRDisjoint`, because a
non-overlapping geometry can lie anywhere on the curve, so a disjoint query scans the full index and
filters. INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE maintain the spatial index transactionally alongside the row,
the same as secondary and full-text indexes.
