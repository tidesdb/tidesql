# Table Maintenance

## ANALYZE TABLE

`ANALYZE TABLE` refreshes the cached statistics and reports the column family internals as
note-level rows in the result set, one block for the data CF and one for each secondary-index CF.
Running it is optional for query planning, since the engine samples secondary-index cardinality
automatically the first time a populated table is planned against, as described in
[Statistics and the Optimizer](/internals/optimizer). `ANALYZE TABLE` re-samples the same figures on
demand and surfaces the internals below:

```
[TIDESDB] CF 'demo__products'  total_keys=10  data_size=636 bytes  levels=5  read_amp=2.00
[TIDESDB] avg_key=18.8 bytes  avg_value=44.0 bytes
[TIDESDB] level 1  sstables=0  size=0 bytes  keys=0
[TIDESDB] level 2  sstables=1  size=636 bytes  keys=10
[TIDESDB] level 3  sstables=0  size=0 bytes  keys=0
[TIDESDB] idx CF 'demo__products__idx_idx_category'  keys=10  data_size=449 bytes  levels=5
[TIDESDB] idx 'idx_category' sampled=10 distinct=4 rec_per_key=2
```

The summary line reports the key count (SSTable entries, which can still include superseded
versions of a key, plus what is still in the memtable), the
data size, the number of LSM levels, and the read amplification factor. Memtable and block-cache
figures are database-level in TidesDB 10 and appear in `SHOW ENGINE TIDESDB STATUS` rather than per
CF. Below the summary come the average key and value sizes and a per-level breakdown of SSTable
count, size, and keys. Each secondary index then gets a line with its column family's key count,
data size, and levels, and each non-unique index a line with the entries sampled (up to 100,000),
the distinct index prefixes seen, and the resulting `rec_per_key`.

When a column family holds B+tree nodes, an extra note reports the tree shape:

```
[TIDESDB] btree  nodes=128  max_height=3  avg_height=2.40
```

When a column family keeps partition-range filters resident, a note reports their memory:

```
[TIDESDB] filters  resident=32768 bytes
```

This is the memory the family's per-SSTable routing directories hold outside the block cache, one
directory per SSTable, so it grows with the SSTable count and shrinks as compaction merges them.

When a column family has committed any user bytes, a write-amplification note is emitted:

```
[TIDESDB] WA  user=4096  wal=4096  flush=8192  compact_write=12288 (1 ssts)  compact_read=8192  ratio=6.00x
```

`user` is the logical bytes the engine wrote through the library's API, `wal` is the WAL bytes
attributed to this family, `flush` and `compact_write` are the bytes written to SSTables by flush
and by compaction, `compact_write` also carries the number of SSTables compaction produced,
`compact_read` is the bytes compaction pulled in as input, and `ratio` is
`(wal + flush + compact_write) / user`. A high ratio with few compaction SSTables points at
oversized flushes, and a high ratio with many points at L0 churn or an under-sized
`L1_FILE_COUNT_TRIGGER`.

## OPTIMIZE TABLE

`OPTIMIZE TABLE` runs a synchronous compaction on every column family of the table, the data CF and
each secondary-index CF, by calling `tidesdb_compact()` on each and blocking until it finishes.
`tidesdb_compact()` runs one forced compaction pass, merging even when no trigger is due, and the
cached statistics are invalidated afterwards so the optimizer sees the post-compaction state
promptly. If a background compaction already holds one of the column families, `tidesdb_compact()`
does not queue behind it and reports the family busy. `OPTIMIZE` then pushes a note saying a
compaction was already in flight and returns `HA_ADMIN_TRY_ALTER`, which MariaDB answers by
recreating the table and analyzing it ("Table does not support optimize, doing recreate + analyze
instead"), so on a busy table the statement can turn into a full table rebuild.

```sql
OPTIMIZE TABLE products;
```

This is the tool to reach for after bulk deletes or updates that leave a large tombstone backlog,
or when `ANALYZE TABLE` reports high read amplification.

## CHECK TABLE and REPAIR TABLE

`CHECK TABLE` fetches the statistics of every column family of the table, the data CF and each
secondary-index CF, through `tidesdb_get_cf_stats()`, and reports the table as corrupt if any of
those calls fails. The library builds these statistics from the SSTable metadata it already holds in
memory, so the check is cheap but shallow. It does not read data blocks or verify their checksums.

```sql
CHECK TABLE orders;
```

`REPAIR TABLE` runs the same forced compaction pass (`tidesdb_compact()`) on every column family,
close to `OPTIMIZE TABLE` but stricter about failure. Any failure to compact the data column family,
including a background compaction already holding it, fails the repair rather than falling back to
a rebuild. A failure on a secondary-index column family is logged as a warning and the repair still
reports OK. A read or corruption error in the SSTables the data CF merge reads fails the repair
rather than being skipped. As with any merge, expired TTL entries are rewritten as tombstones, and
tombstones become eligible to drop once the merge reaches the largest level.

```sql
REPAIR TABLE orders;
```
