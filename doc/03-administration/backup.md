# Backup and Checkpoint

## Online backup

Setting `tidesdb_backup_dir` to a directory path triggers a consistent backup of the whole TidesDB
data directory:

```sql
SET GLOBAL tidesdb_backup_dir = '/path/to/backup';
```

The backup runs without blocking reads and writes. The target directory must not exist or must be
empty. The engine frees the calling connection's own transaction before starting, because the
backup waits for open transactions to drain and would otherwise wait on the caller. After it
completes, the variable reflects the path of the last successful backup. Clear it with an empty
string:

```sql
SET GLOBAL tidesdb_backup_dir = '';
```

## Checkpoint

Setting `tidesdb_checkpoint_dir` takes a checkpoint, which forces a durability barrier on the live
database and then writes a consistent copy of it to the given path:

```sql
SET GLOBAL tidesdb_checkpoint_dir = '/path/to/checkpoint';
```

The path must not exist or must be empty. The durability barrier flushes the memtable and forces the
value log, the write-ahead log, and the manifest to disk regardless of the sync mode, so the live
database is fully durable to this point, and the copy left at the path is a consistent,
directly-openable database. This differs from `tidesdb_backup_dir` above, which writes the same kind
of copy but does not force the extra durability barrier on the live database first. Use a checkpoint
when you want the running database made durable as part of the snapshot, and a backup when you only
need the copy.

## Flush for a physical copy

`FLUSH TABLES ... FOR EXPORT` takes a table lock so the data directory files hold still while you
copy them, and `UNLOCK TABLES` releases it after copying:

```sql
FLUSH TABLES orders FOR EXPORT;
-- copy the column family directories from tidesdb_data/
UNLOCK TABLES;
```
