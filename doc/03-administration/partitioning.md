# Partitioning

TidesDB tables can be partitioned with MariaDB's standard partitioning syntax. Each partition
becomes a separate TidesDB table, and therefore a separate column family, so compaction and flushes
happen independently per partition.

```sql
CREATE TABLE metrics (
  id    INT NOT NULL,
  ts    DATE NOT NULL,
  value DOUBLE,
  PRIMARY KEY (id, ts)
) ENGINE=TIDESDB
PARTITION BY RANGE COLUMNS(ts) (
  PARTITION p_2024   VALUES LESS THAN ('2025-01-01'),
  PARTITION p_2025   VALUES LESS THAN ('2026-01-01'),
  PARTITION p_future VALUES LESS THAN MAXVALUE
);
```

All of MariaDB's partitioning schemes work, `HASH`, `KEY`, `RANGE`, `LIST`, and `RANGE COLUMNS`.
Secondary indexes on partitioned tables work too, with each partition holding its own index column
family.

Partitions are added and dropped with `ALTER TABLE`. Dropping a partition removes all of its data:

```sql
ALTER TABLE metrics ADD PARTITION (PARTITION p_2026 VALUES LESS THAN ('2027-01-01'));
ALTER TABLE metrics DROP PARTITION p_2024;
```

One limitation to note, a partitioned table cannot carry a vector index, which is covered in
[Vector Search](/reference/vector-search).
