# Monitoring

TideSQL exposes engine state two ways. `SHOW ENGINE TIDESDB STATUS` prints a human-readable report,
and `SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'tidesdb%'` returns machine-readable counters for a monitoring agent.
The full counter list is in [Status Variables](/reference/status-variables). This chapter is about
which of them matter.

The counters are refreshed on demand behind a short coalescing window rather than by a background
thread, so a burst of reads in one `SHOW` triggers a single stats pass and rapid polling reuses the
snapshot. A counter can therefore be up to a couple of seconds stale, which is fine for monitoring
and worth remembering if you sample immediately after a schema change.

## SHOW ENGINE TIDESDB STATUS

```sql
SHOW ENGINE TIDESDB STATUS\G
```

The report is organized into sections:

- **Identity** - data directory, column family count, global sequence, min snapshot sequence, and
  active transaction count.
- **Memory** - memtable bytes and transaction memory bytes.
- **Storage** - total SSTables, open SSTable handles, total data size, and immutable memtable count.
- **Background** - flush pending, compaction pending, whether a flush is in flight, the WAL
  generation, and the next column family index.
- **Write Amplification** - user bytes written, flush bytes with the SSTable count, compaction
  bytes with the number of compaction jobs (printed as `Compaction bytes written: N (N compactions)`),
  compaction bytes read, value-log bytes written, and the derived total WA ratio, whose
  numerator sums flush, compaction, and value-log output so value separation is not under-counted.
- **Value Log** - file size, indexed value count, used bytes, the stored, live, and dead byte
  totals, the segment count with how many are drainable or retired, and the reclaim calls and passes.
- **Write Stalls** - writes throttled, writes blocked, total stall time, and admission ceiling hits.
- **Block Cache** - enabled, entries, size, hits, misses, hit rate, and partitions.
- **IO Device Writes** - per-class write count, bytes, and average and worst write latency for the
  SSTable, WAL, and value-log classes. Writes are metered through the library's descriptor manager,
  which covers key logs, the write-ahead log, and value-log segments. The manifest is not metered,
  and these are write-side figures only.
- **Write Stalls By Reason** - the stall count with total and worst time for each cause a commit can
  stall on, splitting the aggregate stall time above across WAL append, memtable rotation, admission
  backlog, and manifest commit.
- **Key Log Encoding** and **Value Log Encoding** - the chain count with the logical and stored byte
  totals and the realized compression ratio for each log.
- **Tombstones** - total tombstones, the database-wide tombstone ratio, and the worst per-SSTable
  density with the level it sits at. These aggregates are computed when the tombstone status
  variables below are read, and this block prints the last values computed, so read
  `SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'tidesdb%tombstone%'` first when you need them current.
- **Column Families** - a per-family breakdown after the aggregate sections, with each family's
  level count, keys and unflushed keys, bytes, read amplification, average key and value size,
  B-tree shape, and tombstone ratio, followed by a per-level line of SSTable count, keys,
  tombstones, and bytes, and the family's WAL bytes and compaction count. Internal families whose
  names start with `__tidesdb` are left out, and families past the report's 32 KiB buffer are
  truncated with a trailing note.

## The numbers to watch

If you graph a few things, graph these.

### write_stall_ceiling_hits

Healthy is zero. Alert on any sustained increase. This counts commits admitted only because the
backpressure wait ceiling expired, the point where the engine stopped waiting for flush to drain and
let the write through to keep a stuck flush from becoming a stuck database. A non-zero value is the
clearest single signal that ingest has outrun flush.

### immutable_memtables and flush_pending

Healthy is near zero, spiking briefly under load. These are sealed memtables waiting to be flushed.
A count that sits above zero means flush is not keeping up with ingest, and it is the leading
indicator for the stalls above. You will see it climb before writers start being held.

### writes_throttled and writes_blocked

These count commits the admission policy made dwell, and commits it made wait for the flush queue to
drain. Rising values under a steady workload point at the same flush-behind-ingest condition as the
two above, at an earlier stage.

### Block cache hit_rate

Watch the trend rather than the value, since what is healthy depends on the workload. Because the
hit and miss counts are cumulative since open, compare deltas between two samples rather than
reading the absolute rate. A falling hit rate on a stable workload means the working set has
outgrown `tidesdb_block_cache_size`.

### tombstone_ratio and max_sst_tombstone_density

A climbing tombstone ratio on a delete-heavy or update-heavy table means dead entries are
accumulating faster than compaction reclaims them, which shows up as slower range scans. The
[Table Maintenance](/administration/maintenance) chapter covers `OPTIMIZE TABLE` and the
tombstone-density trigger for acting on it.

### min_snapshot_sequence versus global_sequence

`min_snapshot_sequence` is the oldest snapshot still pinned, the floor below which compaction cannot
reclaim old versions. When it lags far behind `global_sequence` a long-running transaction is
holding back garbage collection, which keeps old versions and their space alive. A large and growing
gap is the signal to find and end that transaction.

### Encoding ratio

Divide `Tidesdb_klog_logical_bytes` by `Tidesdb_klog_stored_bytes`, and the value-log pair the same
way, for the realized compression ratio of each log. A ratio near 1.0 on data you expected to
compress means the codec is spending CPU for little gain, so the encoding pipeline is worth revisiting
for that workload. The Key Log Encoding and Value Log Encoding blocks of `SHOW ENGINE TIDESDB STATUS`
show the same totals with the number of codec chains in use.

### commit_conflicts and the stmt_ counters

Every library error the engine hands back to the server passes through one mapping, which also
counts it. `Tidesdb_commit_conflicts` counts COMMIT statements that failed with a conflict-class
error, a deadlock or a lock wait timeout. The client sees these as error 1180 ("Got error N during
COMMIT"), wrapping handler error 149 (deadlock) for a write-write conflict. The server increments
`Com_commit` for a failed COMMIT as well as a successful one, so subtract this counter to get
committed transactions. When the transaction goes through two-phase commit, as it does with the
binary log enabled, the conflict check runs in the prepare phase instead, and a conflict found there
reaches the client as the same 1180 and is counted here as well.

Errors raised inside a statement are counted by cause instead. `Tidesdb_stmt_conflicts` counts
write-write conflicts, which reach the client as a deadlock (1213). `Tidesdb_stmt_bf_aborted` counts
local transactions a Galera applier aborted, also a deadlock. `Tidesdb_stmt_locked` counts transient
library contention that reached a statement, after the engine has retried a locked read, write,
delete, iterator open, or iterator seek up to 16 times with a short growing backoff (a commit, and an
iterator step, is never retried).
`Tidesdb_stmt_memory_limit` counts memtable backpressure that outlasted the library's admission
policy, and `Tidesdb_stmt_txn_expired` counts transactions that outlived their timeout. All three
reach the client as a lock wait timeout (1205). A rising `stmt_conflicts` or `commit_conflicts` is
real contention between transactions, while a rising `stmt_locked` or `stmt_memory_limit` points at
the engine falling behind rather than at the workload.
