# Replication and High Availability

TideSQL stores data on one node. Replication and clustering come from the layers above the engine,
and within those layers TideSQL is a first-class participant rather than a generic pass-through. It
carries the binlog capabilities MariaDB replication needs, it commits through the two-phase protocol
that keeps a replica crash-safe, and it participates directly in Galera certification, including the
cross-node conflict resolution that keeps a multi-master cluster from diverging.

## MariaDB replication

A TideSQL table replicates like any other. The engine is both row and statement binlog capable, so
`binlog_format` of `ROW`, `STATEMENT`, or `MIXED` all work, with row-based replication the natural
fit for an optimistic engine because it ships the resulting row images rather than re-running a
statement whose outcome depends on commit ordering.

Commits go through the binlog two-phase protocol. The engine prepares durably before the binlog
writes, and it commits in binlog order through the group-commit hook, so a crash between the binlog
and the engine recovers to a consistent point and a replica built from that binlog is consistent
with the primary. The prepare phase runs the same conflict checks as a commit, so with the binlog
enabled a write-write conflict is reported when the transaction prepares. Commit behavior is covered
in [Transactions and Isolation](/concepts/transactions).

Nothing engine-specific has to be enabled. A table created with `ENGINE=TIDESDB` on the primary
replicates to a replica running the same engine through the standard replication configuration.

## Galera cluster

TideSQL advertises the Galera replication capability, so a table created with `ENGINE=TIDESDB` in a
wsrep-enabled server is replicated to every node in the cluster and certified in the global order the
provider assigns. The engine does three things for the cluster.

It appends a certification key for every row a transaction changes, built from the primary key and
from each unique index, so a write to the same row or the same unique value on another node is caught
as a conflict rather than silently diverging the replicas. A key with a NULL part constrains nothing
and is skipped. A table with no unique key certifies each of its ordinary indexes instead, and a
table with no certifiable key at all appends a table-level exclusive key, which serializes its
writes across the cluster. When an update changes a key, the keys of both the before and the after
image are appended, so the row's old identity stays covered. Inserts, updates, and deletes append
their keys as exclusive keys.

It resolves a cross-node write-write conflict the way InnoDB does, without a pessimistic lock. When
an applier replays a cluster write that collides with a local uncommitted transaction, the engine
brute-force aborts that local transaction through the server before it certifies, so the losing side
rolls back cleanly instead of committing a write the other nodes cannot apply. A lock-free store
parks no row lock for the applier to block on, so the engine keeps a small write-intent record for
each uncommitted write, keyed by the row's primary key and by each non-NULL unique value it writes,
and uses it to find and abort the local loser. An aborted transaction fails its next operation,
its commit included, and the application on the losing side sees a deadlock error and retries, the
same outcome InnoDB produces for the same race.

It persists the cluster position in a dedicated internal column family, `__tidesdb_wsrep_meta`, so
a node that restarts or rejoins knows where it left off and the provider can bring it back through
state transfer.

## What an application sees under conflict

On a single node, an optimistic write-write conflict surfaces at COMMIT as error 1180 wrapping
handler error 149 (deadlock), or mid-statement as a deadlock (1213), and the application retries,
described in [Limitations](/appendix/limitations). Across a cluster the losing transaction of a
cross-node conflict is aborted and reaches the client as a deadlock, which an application should
handle by retrying the transaction. Autocommit statements are retried by the server automatically,
up to `wsrep_retry_autocommit` times. The winner's row stands identically on every node, so the
replicas stay converged.
