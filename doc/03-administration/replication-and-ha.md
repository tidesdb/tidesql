# Replication and High Availability

TideSQL stores data on one node. Replication and clustering come from the layers above the engine,
and within those layers TideSQL is a first-class participant rather than a generic pass-through. It
carries the binlog capabilities MariaDB replication needs, it commits through the two-phase protocol
that keeps a replica crash-safe, and it participates directly in Galera certification, including the
cross-node conflict resolution that keeps a multi-master cluster from diverging.

## MariaDB replication

A TideSQL table replicates like any other. The engine is both row and statement binlog capable, so
`binlog_format` of `ROW`, `STATEMENT`, or `MIXED` all work, with row-based replication the natural
fit for an optimistic engine because it ships the resulting row images rather than re-running a
statement whose outcome depends on commit ordering.

Commits go through the binlog two-phase protocol. The engine prepares durably before the binlog
writes, and it commits in binlog order through the group-commit hook, so a crash between the binlog
and the engine recovers to a consistent point and a replica built from that binlog is consistent
with the primary. Group commit also means a busy primary amortizes the durability cost across the
transactions that commit together, which is covered in
[Transactions and Isolation](/concepts/transactions).

Nothing engine-specific has to be enabled. A table created with `ENGINE=TIDESDB` on the primary
replicates to a replica running the same engine through the standard replication configuration.

## Galera cluster

TideSQL advertises the Galera replication capability, so a table created with `ENGINE=TIDESDB` in a
wsrep-enabled server is replicated to every node in the cluster and certified in the global order the
provider assigns. The engine does three things for the cluster.

It appends a certification key for every row a transaction changes, built from the primary key and
from each unique index, so a write to the same row or the same unique value on another node is caught
as a conflict rather than silently diverging the replicas. An update appends the keys of both the
before and the after image, so the row's old identity stays covered.

It resolves a cross-node write-write conflict the way InnoDB does, without a pessimistic lock. When
an applier replays a cluster write that collides with a local uncommitted transaction, the engine
brute-force aborts that local transaction through the server before it certifies, so the losing side
rolls back cleanly instead of committing a write the other nodes cannot apply. A lock-free store
parks no row lock for the applier to block on, so the engine keeps a small write-intent record for
each uncommitted write and uses it to find and abort the local loser. The application on the losing
side sees a deadlock error and retries, the same outcome InnoDB produces for the same race.

It persists the cluster position in a dedicated internal column family, so a node that restarts or
rejoins knows where it left off and the provider can bring it back through state transfer.

## What an application sees under conflict

On a single node, an optimistic write-write conflict surfaces at commit and the application retries,
described in [Limitations](/appendix/limitations). Across a cluster the losing transaction of a
cross-node conflict is aborted and reaches the client as a deadlock, which an application should
handle by retrying the transaction. Autocommit statements are retried by the server automatically.
The winner's row stands identically on every node, so the replicas stay converged.
