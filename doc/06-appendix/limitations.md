# Limitations

**Foreign keys carry two shape restrictions.** TideSQL enforces foreign keys inside the engine,
including `ON DELETE` and `ON UPDATE` with `CASCADE`, `SET NULL`, and `RESTRICT`, references to a
primary key or to a non-nullable unique key, and self-references. Two constraint shapes are rejected
at `CREATE TABLE` and `ALTER TABLE`. A foreign key column declared with descending order is not
allowed, because the engine matches child rows against a forward sort key. A foreign key that
references a nullable unique key is not allowed either, because the value-only child probe cannot
reproduce that key's null indicator. Everything else behaves as in InnoDB. See
[Foreign Keys](/reference/foreign-keys) for the full description.

**Changing the primary key or a column type needs a full copy.** The engine does not support an
inplace primary-key change, and changing a column type such as `INT` to `BIGINT` also rebuilds the
table by copy. See [Online DDL](/administration/online-ddl).

**Statistics are cached for up to two seconds.** Right after a bulk load the optimizer may briefly
see stale row counts. `ANALYZE TABLE` forces an immediate refresh.

**Write conflicts surface at commit and are the application's to retry.** Concurrency is optimistic
MVCC, so a multi-statement transaction at `REPEATABLE READ` or higher can fail at commit with a
first-committer-wins conflict, which reaches the client as `ER_ERROR_DURING_COMMIT` (ERROR 1180). An
application that uses explicit `BEGIN ... COMMIT` blocks at those levels should retry on that error.
MariaDB retries autocommit statements automatically. There are no pessimistic row locks, so there
are no lock waits and no lock-wait deadlocks to tune. See
[Transactions and Isolation](/concepts/transactions).
